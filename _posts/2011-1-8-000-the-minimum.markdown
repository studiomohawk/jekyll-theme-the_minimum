##About the\_minimum

the\_minimum is my first attempt for theming jekyll and this theme is used for [\_layout - themes for jekyll](http://layouts.studiomohawk.com).
This theme(or any other jekyll theme I design) is using HTML5 and CSS3.

###Note
I really don't care about IE at all. Not even IE9.(May work just fine)
You can ask me questions but don't expect me to make this compatible with IE.

###changelog
Refer this at github.
