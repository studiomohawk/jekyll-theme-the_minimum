* Theme Name: the\_minimum
* Description: A minimumlist theme for [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).
* Author: Yuya Saito @ [\_layout](http://www.layouts-the.me/)
* Version: 1.5.1

## About the\_minimum

* Using HTML5 and CSS3 for clean semantic code
* Using Responsive web design which means design adapts screen size
* Main stylesheet(style.less) is written with LESS(**You need less installed**)
* Rakefile to minify css (rake juicer:css).

  If you need to optimize change master.css to master.min at \_includes/system\_head.html
  If you ever change anything, **you have to type** command rake juicer:css to
  rebuild minified css.
  I'm trying to figure out how to regex strings in html via rake so that you
  don't have to do this manually, if you know how please help me. Thanks.

  **Default is NOT linking to minified CSS, you should minifiy css to reduce
  http requests**

## This theme is free but some strings are attached
